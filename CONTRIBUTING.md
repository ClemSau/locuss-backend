# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following are a set of guidelines for contributing to locuss-backend.

## Getting Started

locuss-backend is built on Django and uses docker and docker-compose to run the project in _every_ environment it is run, as well as for tests.

Please make sure you are familiar with the project before contributing.

After you've read over the docs, you can look through the issues tagged with ["good first issue"](https://github.com/ClemSau/locuss-backend/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) in the project.

The product road map can be found in the [project board](https://www.notion.so/00c82ffee92749479b71709e74ac8a14?v=b153bab6ceb248ad8c7ef0c7199315c9)

## Issues
If you encounter a bug or would like to suggest enhancements, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/ClemSau/locuss-backend/issues)

There is no blueprint on how to write an issue yet so try to be as precise as possible and  make sure your request hasn't been made before.

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are always welcome. 

 1. Pull requests must have a passing build (passing tests, and linter) to be approved
 2. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. It should include:
    -  A summary of the changes being proposed
    -  An estimated priority (low/medium/high)
    -  An appropriate tag (bugfix, enhancement)
    -  A description of smoke testing procedure one could follow
    -  A reference Issue that is being addressed. If one doesn't exist, add one first
